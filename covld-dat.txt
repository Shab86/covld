# This is a dummy data file, which illustrates the input format required
# by covld.py.  Each row is a two-locus diploid genotype coded as
# follows.  At each locus, choose an allele at random, and then count
# the number of copies of that allele in each genotype.  For example,
# if we were counting Ts, then genotypes AA, AT, and TT, would become
# 0, 1, and 2.  The data file consists of two columns delimited by
# whitespace.  Each column is a series of 0/1/2 values, which
# represent the genotypes at that locus in the individuals in the
# sample.
#
# Here are some data from two linked HapMap loci
